# 🧠 Combined Non-Manual Feature Extraction and Textual Integration for ISL

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on extracting and integrating **non-manual features** of Indian Sign Language (ISL), such as **facial expressions, head movements, and eye gaze**, and converting them into a **unified textual description** in real time.

Unlike many ISL systems that focus only on hand gestures, this project emphasizes the **non-manual components**, which are essential for conveying meaning, emotion, and context in sign language.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect facial expressions using geometric landmark analysis  
- Track head movements (nodding and shaking)  
- Estimate eye gaze direction (left, right, center)  
- Apply temporal smoothing for stable predictions  
- Integrate all features into a single descriptive sentence  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- Classical Computer Vision Techniques:
  - Motion tracking  
  - Geometric transformations  
  - Distance-based feature extraction

## ⚙️ Features Implemented

### 😊 Facial Expression Detection
- Happy  
- Surprised  
- Neutral  

### 🤕 Head Movement Detection
- Nodding (Yes)  
- Shaking (No)  
- Stable  

### 👀 Eye Gaze Detection
- Looking Left  
- Looking Right  
- Center

## 🧾 Sample Output
Expression: Happy
Head: Nodding
Gaze: Looking Left

→ Person is nodding with a happy expression while looking left
